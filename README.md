Q1: What is software engineering, and why is it important?
Software engineering is a branch of computer science focused on developing, testing, and maintaining software. It ensures reliability, efficiency, scalability, and security in software systems, which are critical for applications like healthcare and finance12.

Q2: What are three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering?

Mastering complexity: Developing methods to manage complex systems.

Mastering process: Establishing structured development processes.

Mastering machine: Optimizing the use of hardware and software resources.

Q3: What are the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?

Planning: Define purpose and scope.

Requirement Analysis: Identify user specifications.

Design: Create the framework.

Coding: Implement the design into code.

Testing: Identify and fix bugs.

Q4: How do Waterfall and Agile methodologies differ?

Feature	Waterfall Methodology	Agile Methodology
Structure	Linear and sequential	Iterative and incremental
Flexibility	Low; changes difficult after a phase	High; adapts to changing requirements
Customer Feedback	Late in the process	Regular feedback during each sprint
Testing	Done at the end	Continuous after each iteration
Examples: Waterfall suits projects with fixed requirements, while Agile is ideal for dynamic or evolving projects.

Q5: What are the roles of a Software Developer, Quality Assurance Engineer, and Project Manager?

Software Developer: Writes, maintains, and updates code; collaborates with team members; reports progress to the project manager.

Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software meets requirements; identifies bugs; develops testing standards.

Project Manager: Leads the team; communicates with clients; tracks milestones; delivers completed projects.

Q6: Why are Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) important?
IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio Code) help write, debug, and test code efficiently. VCS (e.g., Git) enables collaboration, tracks changes, supports branching/merging, and allows error recovery.

Q7: What challenges do software engineers face, and how can they overcome them?
Challenges include rapid technological advancements, time constraints, limited infrastructure, changing requirements, security issues, and usability concerns. Solutions include continuous learning, agile methodologies, robust infrastructure, modular design, research on security threats, and scalable architecture.

Q8: What are the types of testing in software quality assurance?

Unit Testing: Tests individual components for functionality.

Integration Testing: Ensures modules work together seamlessly.

System Testing: Verifies overall system functionality against requirements.

Acceptance Testing: Confirms the system meets user needs before deployment.

Q9: What is prompt engineering in AI? Why is it important?
Prompt engineering involves crafting inputs to guide AI models toward desired outputs. It improves user experience by generating relevant results quickly, increases flexibility with domain-neutral prompts, and gives developers more control over AI interactions.

Q10: Can you provide an example of improving a vague prompt?

Vague Prompt: "Draw a picture of a person."

Improved Prompt: "Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background."
